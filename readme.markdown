# Typoread

Generate awesome previews of your texts written in MarkDown in one command.

## How to use (for Mac)

1. Install [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "MarkDown"), awesome way to write texts by John Gruber.
2. Download my markdown bash script and copy it to some folder you have in your PATH. Make it executable (chmod a+x markdown).
3. You're done.

Now if you finished writing your text, type "markdown filename" (filename is name of your file). It will create HTML file in the same folder and with the same name your text file has. The HTML file also has some styling for reading pleasure.
